An order aims to recognise the outstanding amenity or intrinsic values that water provides, in either a natural or modified state. Orders may be applied over rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, wetlands, or aquifers, and can cover freshwater or geothermal water. If granted by the Minister, a Water Conservation Order can restrict or prohibit water â€˜takesâ€™, discharges and other uses of the water. Water Conservation Orders can be used to preserve that natural state or protect characteristics such as: the water body's value as a habitat or fishery its wild and scenic nature its value for recreational, historic, spiritual, cultural or scenic purposes. A water body may also hold particular significance for Maori. Applications to the Minister must set out the reasons for the application. If the Minister accepts the application then he or she must appoint a special tribunal to hear and report on the application. The special tribunal then publicly notifies the application and calls for submissions. Submissions must be lodged within 20 working days of the public notice unless a later date is set. Any person may make a submission to the special tribunal. The tribunal then holds a hearing and prepares a report on the application, which will include either a draft Water Conservation Order or a recommendation that the application be declined. This report is sent to the applicant, the Minister, the relevant local and iwi authorities, and every submitter. Anyone who made a submission has a further right of submission to the Environment Court on the special tribunal's report. The Environment Court must hold an inquiry if it receives one or more submissions. If there is such an application to the Environment Court, once it has completed its inquiry, the Environment Court makes a report to the Minister recommending that the special tribunal's report be accepted or rejected with or without modifications. The Minister must make a recommendation to the Governor-General in accordance with the report of the special tribunal or, if the Environment Court has held an inquiry, the report of the Environment Court. If a Water Conservation Order is recommended, the Governor-General then makes the order â€” by order in council. An order can prohibit or restrict a regional council issuing new water and discharge permits, although it can not affect existing permits. Regional policy statements, regional plans and district plans must be consistent with the provisions of a Water Conservation Order.

It is intended to provide a basis for informing further detailed landscape studies in the region. The focus of the report is on large-scale landscape patterns that are able to be distinguished at a regional level, rather than site specific analysis. Detailed studies are likely to identify more features that are distinguishable at a local level, as well as refine specific boundaries in response to finer grained analysis.</p><p>Copyright statement: Boffa Miskell/Environment Canterbury</p>"],"format":["csv,kml/shp,other geo,api"],"update_frequency":["Other-Unknown"],"cost":["No"],"license":["Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence"]},"_id":"V6uuiXdxHTLtPXY6"}

The FENZ wetlands layer is focused on freshwater palustrine wetlands and standing waterbodies with a 500 m maximum length. It does not include estuarine, marine, riverine and lacustrine hydrosystems because these are (or will be) the focus of analogous classification and ranking projects.In 2003 Environment Canterbury provided the Department of Conservation with existing regional wetland survey information of the 1980s and 1990s, collated into a GIS database and report (Davis 1999). This, together with information from other national database's was checked against satellite imagery collected between September 1999 and 2003 to complete delineation of wetland extent. The baseline for â€˜currentâ€™ wetland extent in the FENZ wetland spatial layer is therefore 1999-2003. Coastal wetland vegetation/habitats were field surveyed, mapped onto aerial photographs, described and entered into a GIS database over the period 2004-2011. Mapped wetlands were described following the hierarchical classification system developed by Johnson and Gerbeaux (2004), which in turn drew on the wetland classification of Clarkson et al. (2003) and the vegetation/habitat mapping and description system of Atkinson (1985). 58 ground-surveyed coastal wetland areas are delimited in the Regional Wetland GIS database. A survey-dated description of each wetland, together with assessments of wetland condition, threats and ecological significance, is provided in the attributes table. The system of field survey and database reporting developed for the regionâ€™s coastal wetland habitats will now be applied to inland freshwater wetlands. Ground-based survey will be carried out to add to, update or improve delineation of wetland areas derived from FENZ, as well as provide a similar level of information on wetland class, vegetation type and overall ecological condition. Results of future wetland survey, ecological description and significance assessment will progressively be added to the Regional Wetland Database.ReferencesAtkinson, I.A.E. 1985.

The location of the front door of an elector's dwelling within the correct meshblock is a fundamental requirement of the electoral system (Section 72 Electoral Act 1993).  Highly desirable priorities for the location of an address point are to have it in the same property and parcel as the dwelling and on the correct side of the physical and legal roads.

Information from the classification is used to develop policy, assess the environment, and report on the quality of river water.<br /></p><p>Stream order is the numerical position of a tributary or section of a river within the entire network. Headwater streams are assigned a stream order of 1. When two tributaries of the same stream order meet, the order increments by one for the next section downstream. However, if two sections meet where one section has higher order than the other, the next section downstream has the same order as the highest upstream section.<br /></p><p>The User Guide is available from <a href=''https://data.mfe.govt.nz/document/123-rec-user-guide-2010/''>data.mfe.govt.nz/document/123-rec-user-guide-2010/</a> .

The reserve potassium is held in minerals in the soil such as mica.

Specifically, it shows how much native (indigenous) vegetation remains within land environments, and how past vegetation loss and legal protection are distributed across New Zealand's landscape. The TEC uses indigenous vegetation as a surrogate for indigenous biodiversity. This includes indigenous ecosystems, habitats and communities: the indigenous species, subspecies and varieties that are supported by indigenous vegetation, and their genetic diversity. The TEC is most appropriately applied to help identify places that are priorities for formal protection against clearance and/or incompatible land-uses, and for ecological restoration to restore lost species, linkages and buffers. The TEC is a combination of three national databases: Land Environments New Zealand (LENZ), classes of the 4th Land Cover Database (LCDB4, based on 2012 satellite imagery) and the protected areas network (version 2012, reflecting areas legally protected for the purpose of natural heritage protection).<br /></p><p>For more information see: Cieraad E, Walker S, Price R, Barringer J. 2015.

Each soil family is defined as a unique combination of attributes (NZSC classification, parent material, rock type, dominant texture and permeability class). Soil classes are further characterised as siblings according to their depth to rock class, stoniness, land type, drainage, texture (more detailed), functional horizons and miscellaneous variant information. The uncertainty of each of these family and sibling attribute classes is specified.  Associated with the soil class layer will be additional map layers of fundamental and derived soil properties. The fundamental soil properties are depth (diggability), depth to slowly permeable layer, rooting depth, rooting barrier, horizon thickness, stoniness, clay and sand content. They are developed from sample information and expert knowledge. The derived soil layers are each based on a model (or pedo-transfer function). Some models are simple lookup tables that depend only on the soil class. Others combine various soil, land use, vegetation, climate or topographic attributes in a mathematical formula.
