1893 Women’s Suffrage Petition	http://archives.govt.nz/has/open-data/1893-womens-suffrage-petition	Department of Internal Affairs	When Governor Glasgow signed the Electoral Bill on 19 September 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing nation in the world where women had won the right to vote. The Bill was the outcome of years of meetings in towns and cities across the country, with women often travelling considerable distances to hear lectures and speeches, pass resolutions and sign petitions. A number of petitions were presented to both Houses of Parliament from the early 1880s till 1893.

1900 Thomas Ward Maps	https://koordinates.com/layer/4233-1900-thomas-ward-maps/	Wellington City Council	<p>Thomas Ward - Authorised Surveyors: Map of the City of Wellington - January 1891- clipped, georeferenced and rectified in July 2011<br /></p><p>Thomas Ward, a licensed surveyor and civil engineer, was contracted in 1889 to produce a detailed map of Wellington central city.<br /></p><p>Over three years, Ward collected information and compiled it into scale map tiles.<br /></p><p>The maps show legal boundaries of properties and streets, buildings and what they were constructed of, street-lamp and fireplug locations.<br /></p><p>The Thomas Ward survey map provides much information about early Wellington. Where building records are not complete, the map is useful for discovering whether present-day buildings were in existence before 1892. It also hints at the nature of the late 19th century city where high-density housing is evident in some parts.<br /></p><p>The rectification of the Thomas Ward maps was completed by the GIS Operations Team at Wellington City Council.  As the scanned images had some skew, the rectification process was unable to be carried out to a high level of accuracy.  The quality of the rectification of the images also depends on the accuracy of the 2011 cadastre vector data which was used as base data as well as the content coverage of the maps to find sufficient and reliable reference points.<br />Please note that a best-fit recitfication over each individual map sheet was attempted, so generally the whole sheet is located correctly, but accuracy of features at any particular location may be slightly misaligned.<br /></p><p>The geofereferenced Thomas Ward maps should only be used as a guide as to the location of historic features.<br /></p>	kml/shp,other geo	Other-Unknown	Yes	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence

Antarctic Geodetic Marks	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/789-antarctic-geodetic-marks/	Land Information New Zealand	<p>This dataset provides information about the position, position accuracy, mark name, mark type, condition and unique four letter code for geodetic marks in terms of New Zealand's official geodetic datum for the Ross Dependency. </p><p>This dataset only includes marks that are within Antarctica. These positions have been generated using geodetic observations such as precise differential GPS or electronic distance and theodolite angles measurements. The positions are either 2D or 3D depending of the availability of this measurement data. </p><p>The source data is from Land Information New Zealand's (LINZ) Landonline system where it is used by Land Surveyors. This dataset is updated daily to reflect changes made in the Landonline.</p><h4>Accuracy</h4><p>Geodetic marks with a coordinate order of 5 or less have been positioned in terms of Ross Sea Region Geodetic Datum 2000 (RSRGD2000) using precise differential GPS techniques. Marks with order 6 have been positioned in terms of RSRGD2000 using precise horizontal angles and distance measurements. Lower order marks (order 7 and greater) are derived from lower accuracy measurement techniques or historical datum transformations, and may be significantly less accurate. </p><p>The accuracy of RSRGD2000 coordinates is described by a series of 'orders' classifications. Positions in terms of RSRGD2000 are described by three-dimensional coordinates (latitude, longitude, ellipsoidal height). The accuracy of a survey mark is indicated by its order. Orders are classifications based on the quality of the coordinate in relation to the datum and in relation to other surrounding marks. For more information see <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heights/heights/coordinate-orders/">www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heigh...</a></p><p>Note that the accuracy applies at the time the mark was last surveyed. Refer to the web geodetic database for historical information about mark coordinates. </p><p>Note also that the existence of a mark in this dataset does not imply that there is currently a physical mark in the ground - the dataset includes destroyed or lost historical marks. The geodetic database provides more information on the mark status, valid at last time it was visited by LINZ.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

Archway Accessions List	http://archives.govt.nz/has/open-data/archway-accessions-list	Department of Internal Affairs	An accession is a discrete group of records transferred into archival custody by a single agency on a specific date.Each accession is assigned a unique numeric code (an accession number) to distinguish it from others and this code is used to manage and control Archives NZ work flow for the records within the accession. The accession codes are prefixed by A, CH, D or W for Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin and Wellington offices respectively. Not all assigned accession codes are linked to a list of transferred records. There can be several reasons for this including uncompleted transfers.Archives NZ has assigned over 9000 accession codes to date.  The accessions shown here are only those with a connection to a list of records as at June 2013. This data is intended to provide a preview of Archives New Zealand's collections. Accessions and their related lists are being added constantly so Archway at www.archway.archives.govt.nz should be consulted for the most up to date and accurate information.

Archway Agency List	http://archives.govt.nz/has/open-data/archway-agency-list	Department of Internal Affairs	Agency documentation is an important part of Archives New Zealand's descriptive model for its archival holdings. An 'agency' is any organisational entity which has engaged in recordkeeping activities such as creating, controlling or transferring public records of archival value to Archives NZ. An agency is normally an independent business with its own record-keeping system. It may be linked to other agencies, most commonly those that came before or after it, or were in control of or controlled by it.There are 5740 approved agencies documented in Archway (Archives New Zealand's online finding aids database) as at 26 June 2013.  These agencies are categorised into the following types:Person (Individuals who transfer records to Archives New Zealand)                         Central government agency                 Local government agency                   District Health Boards                             State schools               Universities                                         Polytechnics                  Other, including Courts, State Owned Enterprises and private companies                              The agencies listed here are only a subset of those documented on Archway. The 'Person' agencies have been excluded and also those agencies not documented to full descriptive standard on Archway. The brief information given here is intended to provide a glimpse of how agencies are displayed in our finding aids system. Full agency documentation includes a summary; an administrative history; links to predecessor/successor and superior/subordinate relationships and links to the records series controlled by the agency.

Cancer patient survival: 1994 to 2011	http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/cancer-patient-survival-covering-period-1994-2011	Ministry of Health	This interactive report supersedes the Cancer patient survival covering the period 1994 to 2007 publication released by the Ministry of Health in 2010.The cancer registration data analysed in this report is from the years 1994 to 2011, with follow-up (mortality) information to 31 December 2013.The report shows a broad overview of cancer survival in New Zealand, and provides information for 24 cancers. Survival is presented by age, sex, ethnic group, extent of disease and deprivation. Survival data has been analysed over time, to show how one-year and five-year survival has changed between 1998 and 2011. Cumulative relative and interval-specific survival is also presented to show survival for up to 10 years after the date of diagnosis.Survival information is provided for 24 cancers. The brackets next to the cancer show the corresponding ICD code(s).

These earthquakes occurred on 2010-09-04, 2011-02-22, 2011-06-13 and 2011-12-23. This layer contains coordinates computed from GNSS surveys undertaken after the Canterbury earthquakes. It also includes Lyttelton Vertical Datum 1937 and Christchurch Drainage Datum heights, derived from the GNSS data.</p><p><strong>Users may also be interested in the simplified data in the companion layer <a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/1589">Canterbury Earthquake Geodetic Marks (2010, 2011) - Simple</a>.</strong></p><p>These coordinates are only provisional. Analysis is ongoing as further data is collected. Coordinates were calculated using SNAP v2.3.61. Stations were constrained using coordinates calculated by GNS Science. Some coordinates were calculated from data provided by Christchurch City Council and other public and private organisations. No precise levelling data has been used.</p><p>The estimated accuracy is 0.02m horizontally and 0.03m vertically for NZGD2000 ellipsoidal heights.

This layer supercedes the Groundwater Recharge Zones 1A, 1B, and 1C layer as shown in Proposed Canterbury Natural Resources Regional Plan 2004. Groundwater recharge means the replenishment of groundwater by infiltration or seepage of water. Includes both rainfall and river recharge of groundwater, and in some areas may include losses through the soil of irrigation water. Variation 6 introduces a new issue, objective, policies and methods, including land use rules and amendments to the existing water quality zone boundaries, relating specifically to the Christchurch Aquifer System. Variation 6 applies to the area of Christchurch City (excluding Banks Peninsula) and also that part of Selwyn District north of Halkett Road. This amendment was brought about as part of delivering on the Greater Christchurch Urban Devlopment Strategy.Christchurch Groundwater Recharge Zone:(Refer Chapter 5: Rule WQN15)The Christchurch Groundwater Recharge Zone comprises part of the urban area of Christchurch City and the land to the west overlying unconfined groundwater. This area is the source of water for the Coastal Confined Gravel Aquifer System from which the city takes its water supply. The Recharge Zone is divided into two zones. Zone 1 is the predominately rural area to the west of the City bounded by the Waimakariri River and a line approximately between Halkett, Prebbleton and the Port Hills. It is an area of permeable gravels containing unconfined shallow groundwater that is at risk of contamination from land use. Within Zone 1 three sub-zones are identified:(a) Zone 1A Christchurch International Airport;(b) Zone 1B existing business areas; and(c) Zone 1C mineral extraction.Zone 2 comprises the existing urban area between Johns and Russley Roads, Marshlands Road and the base of the Port Hills.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

We expect this distribution mechanism will be established near the end of 2015 and the next release of surveys will occur at that time.</p><p>See: <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/what-were-doing/projects/crown-historic-aerial-photo-archive-scanning-project"><a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/what-were-doing/projects/crown-historic-aerial-photo-archive-scanning-project">www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/what-were-doing/projec...</a></a> for information about the Crown historic aerial photo archive digitisation project.</p><p>The original data used to create this layer was compiled prior to 2000 and it is possible that some errors exist in the data fields.

FSL   Depth to Slowly Permeable Horizon	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/108-fsl-depth-to-slowly-permeable-horizon/	Landcare Research	<p>The New Zealand Fundamental Soil Layer originates from a relational join of features from two databases: the New Zealand Land Resource Inventory (NZLRI), and the National Soils Database (NSD). The NZLRI is a national polygon database of physical land resource information, including a soil unit. Soil is one in an inventory of five physical factors (including rock, slope, erosion, and vegetation) delineated by physiographic polygons at approximately 1:50,000 scale. The NSD is a point database of soil physical, chemical, and mineralogical characteristics for over 1500 soil profiles nationally. A relational join between the NZLRI dominant soil and derivative tables from the NSD was the means by which 14 important soil attributes were attached to the NZLRI polygons. Some if these attributes originate from exact matches with NSD records, while others derive from matches to similar soils or professional estimates. This layer contains depth to slowly permeable horizon attributes. Depth to a slowly permeable horizon describes the minimum and maximum depths (in metres) to a horizon in which the permeability is less than 4mm/hr as measured by techniques outlined in Griffiths (1985). If no slowly permeable horizon is observed, the taxon is allocated to Class 6 and a null value with numeric code -.99 is entered into the data fields.

FSL New Zealand Soil Classification	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/79-fsl-new-zealand-soil-classification/	Landcare Research	<p>The soil fundamental data layers (FDLs) contain spatial information for 16 key attributes, each of which is measurable (i.e. is given a numeric value rather than being assigned to a descriptive class or category) and is recorded in appropriate units of measure. Since attributes have measurable values, FDLs are particularly useful in computer modelling and have enabled researchers and resource management decision-makers to make the most of rapid developments in GIS technology. Key soil attributes were selected through a consultation process with stakeholders, and generally fall into three groups: soil fertility/toxicity, soil physical properties (particularly those related to soil moisture), and topography/climate (T). Parameters include slope, potential rooting depth, topsoil gravel content, proportion of rock outcrop, pH, salinity, cation exchange capacity, total carbon, phosphorus retention, flood interval, soil temperature, total profile available water, profile readily available water, drainage, and macropores (shallow and deep).<br /></p><p>Regional soil databases were the key to generating FDLs. New Zealand was subdivided into several geographic regions and soil scientists were allocated a region for which they developed a â€˜regional legendâ€™, i.e. database. Regional data were correlated using the New Zealand Soil Classification (NZSC), referenced to the National Soils Database (NSD) and other relevant data sources, and then linked to the soil polygons in the New Zealand Land Resource Inventory (NZLRI). This layer holds the NZSC data upon which the remaining FSLs were based.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Landcare Data Use License

It represents this species' final layer as part of the Natural Heritage Management Strategy of the Department of Conservation.<br /></p><p>Spatial and textual data were collected at the Area level by Department of Conservation Area Office and Conservancy Office staff.  Polygons representing the distribution were hand-drawn onto LINZ 260 series topo maps at the 1:250,000 scale.  Digitisation of the hand-drawn maps was contracted to Geographx (NZ) Limited.<br /></p><p>Freshwater lakes, ponds and rivers were clipped from the layer to represent species absence. Further digitisation work was carried out by the DOC R&D GIS team in Christchurch to re-define selected polygons by species specific distribution drivers; i.e. altitude and habitat guided by LCBD 2.  The attribute table may contain references to quantitative datasets of species abundance (where such datasets exist).<br /></p><p>For full explanation of data collection methodology see DOCDM-186114.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

Hedgehog distribution in Northland (1 July 2007)	http://koordinates.com/layer/1605-hedgehog-distribution-in-northland-1-july-2007/	Department of Conservation	<p>This dataset represents the terrestrial distribution of Hedgehog (Erinaceous europaeus europaeus) in Northland as at 1 July 2007.  It represents this species' final layer as part of the Natural Heritage Management Strategy of the Department of Conservation.<br /></p><p>Spatial and textual data were collected at the Area level by Department of Conservation Area Office and Conservancy Office staff.  Polygons representing the distribution were hand-drawn onto LINZ 260 series topo maps at the 1:250,000 scale.  Digitisation of the hand-drawn maps was contracted to Geographx (NZ) Limited.<br /></p><p>Freshwater lakes, ponds and rivers were clipped from the layer to represent species absence. Further digitisation work was carried out by the DOC R&D GIS team in Christchurch to re-define selected polygons by species specific distribution drivers; i.e. altitude and habitat guided by LCBD 2.  The attribute table may contain references to quantitative datasets of species abundance (where such datasets exist).<br /></p><p>For full explanation of data collection methodology see DOCDM-186114.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

To extract as much information as possible from these data, a surface was fitted first that predicted for each month the ratio of solar radiation reaching the earth's surface to that reaching the top of the atmosphere, with the latter calculated from solar geometry equations. In fitting this surface, only the 18 data points where measurements were made of both solar radiation and sunshine hours were used.<br /></p><p>In addition to NZMG coordinates, it used as an additional predictor the ratio of measured sunshine hours for each month to the maximum possible sunshine hours given no cloud. This surface was then used to estimate the monthly solar radiation received at each of the 80 sites for which measurements of sunshine hours alone were available. Using a total of 98 sites for which solar radiation data were either measured directly or estimated from sunshine hours, surfaces predicting annual and monthly solar radiation were then fitted. Data describing monthly humidity was used as a surrogate measure of cloudiness to improve the fit of the surface to the underlying data. This also increases the local accuracy of the surface predictions, as the number of meteorological stations used to fit the humidity surface is more than three times greater than the number of sites used to fit the solar radiation surface.<br /></p><p>The units for this layer are in MJ/m2/day, higher values signifiy areas that have higher levels of solar radiation. This layer has been multiplied by a factor of 10 (i.e. converted into an integer grid) to save space and make the grids more responsive.

Based on a water balance model using monthly estimates of mean daily temperature, mean daily solar radiation, and mean rainfall. This layer is the annual average of the monthly ratios of rainfall to potential evaporation calculated using the method of Priestley and Taylor (1972). The resulting 100 metre layer (The temperature, solar radiation and rainfall layers were all 100m) was then interpolated to 25 metres using bilinear interpolation.<br /></p><p>The climate station data used in the development of this climate surface were derived from summaries of climate observations published by the New Zealand Meteorological Service, using data collected over the period from 1950-1980 The data layer was derived from surfaces fitted to monthly data describing daily average temperature, daily solar radiation and monthly rainfall. The rainfall surface was fitted using NZMG coordinates, elevation, and a model describing relationships between topography and westerly winds. Having derived the 36 input climate layers, an empirical model was first used to calculate the monthly potential evaporation from the monthly estimates of solar radiation and temperature. These estimates of evaporation were then compared with the monthly rainfall estimates. To calculate the monthly water balance ratio, the ratio of rainfall to evaporation was computed for each month, and then the average of these twelve ratios was calculated.<br /></p><p>Additional details such as the climate station locations used in the creation of the layer are defined in the attached LENZ Technical Guide.</p>	other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Landcare Data Use License

The climate station data used in the development of this climate surface were derived from summaries of climate observations published by the New Zealand Meteorological Service, using data collected over the period from 1950-1980. Estimates of the vapour pressure deficit for each month were derived by coupling a 100 m DEM with a thin-plate spline surface fitted to an irregular network of 287 meteorological stations, using humidity and temperature data. The resulting 100 metre layer was then interpolated to 25 metres using bilinear interpolation.<br /></p><p>Calculation of the vapour pressure deficit first required estimation of the temperature at 0900 hours, the time at which humidity measurements are made. This was calculated from the measured mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures for each month using a function that simulates the temperature course through the day. The estimated temperature at 0900 hours was then used to calculate the saturation water vapour pressure , which indicates the maximum amount of water vapour able to be held in the air given its temperature. Vapour pressure deficits in October were used in LENZ as this is the month when westerly winds are generally most persistent, resulting in strong geographic variation in vapour pressure deficits across New Zealand.<br /></p><p>This layer has been multiplied by a factor of 100 (i.e. converted into an integer grid) to save space and make the grids more responsive.

Additional intermediate contours and spot heights were used in generating the DEM where available, while coastlines and shorelines (for lakes greater than 10 ha in extent) were used to constrain the DEM surface around water bodies. The linear interpolation method used to create the DEM threads contours through the cells before interpolation so that any cell intersected by a contour will be given the elevation value of that contour, leading to a high percentage of cells with elevations that are multiples of 20 or 10 in steep areas.<br /></p><p>Additional details are defined in the attached LENZ Technical Guide.</p>	other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Landcare Data Use License

Note, where minor line-work improvements were applied using automated processes, the EditDate and Authorify have not been changed (but the â€œNonTemporalâ€ attribute is still set true). This layer was produced with a tolerance of 50cm as a zero tolerance generates slivers too small for the portal software to project correctly. Funding is from the Ministry for Science and Innovation under contract CO9X1101, which was contributed to by the Ministry for the Environment. The Department of Conservation and individual regional councils and territorial authorities have made significant in kind contributions by checking the draft mapping for their areas of interest.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

Land_of_Regional_Significance_2010	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7603-land-of-regional-significance-2010/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>In 2010, Environment Canterbury commissioned a report that identifies areas of outstanding natural features and landscapes (ONF/Ls) at a regional scale throughout Canterbury. It is a comprehensive, technical, peer-reviewed update of the Canterbury Regional Landscape Study of 1993, which was one of the first regional landscape analyses completed in response to the 1991 Resource Management Act in New Zealand.The report builds upon the methods used in 1993 and reflects current best practice in landscape assessment. It is intended to provide a basis for informing further detailed landscape studies in the region. The focus of the report is on large-scale landscape patterns that are able to be distinguished at a regional level, rather than site specific analysis. Detailed studies are likely to identify more features that are distinguishable at a local level, as well as refine specific boundaries in response to finer grained analysis.</p><p>Copyright statement: Boffa Miskell/Environment Canterbury</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

Mudfish Habitat	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7524-mudfish-habitat/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>Mudfish(Refer Chapter 5: Rule WQN20The Department of Conservationâ€™s New Zealand mudfish (Neochanna spp.) recovery plan 2003-13, has identified the Canterbury mudfish (Neochanna burrowsius) as acutely threatened. Mudfish are characteristically hard to find. The adults are nocturnal, and the species' ability to aestivate (burrow into mud for periods of several weeks) adds to the difficulty of identifying their presence.The places indicated on the planning maps have all been verified since 2000, but even recent observations can be difficult to replicate, and new discoveries are still being made. For mapping purposes, information recorded for a site has been extrapolated in the light of known mudfish behaviour to include areas of the same waterbody beyond the actual record site.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

NRRP Christchurch Groundwater Protection Zone	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7517-nrrp-christchurch-groundwater-protection-zone/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>Christchurch Groundwater Protection Zones as ammended by Variation 6 to the Proposed Canterbury Natural Resources Regional Plan, Chapter 4: Water Quality. This layer supercedes the Groundwater Recharge Zones layer as shown in Proposed Canterbury Natural Resources Regional Plan 2004. Groundwater recharge means the replenishment of groundwater by infiltration or seepage of water. Includes both rainfall and river recharge of groundwater, and in some areas may include losses through the soil of irrigation water. Variation 6 introduces a new issue, objective, policies and methods, including land use rules and amendments to the existing water quality zone boundaries, relating specifically to the Christchurch Aquifer System. Variation 6 applies to the area of Christchurch City (excluding Banks Peninsula) and also that part of Selwyn District north of Halkett Road. This amendment was brought about as part of delivering on the Greater Christchurch Urban Devlopment Strategy.Christchurch Groundwater Recharge Zone:(Refer Chapter 5: Rule WQN15)The Christchurch Groundwater Recharge Zone comprises part of the urban area of Christchurch City and the land to the west overlying unconfined groundwater. This area is the source of water for the Coastal Confined Gravel Aquifer System from which the city takes its water supply. The Recharge Zone is divided into two zones. Zone 1 is the predominately rural area to the west of the City bounded by the Waimakariri River and a line approximately between Halkett, Prebbleton and the Port Hills. It is an area of permeable gravels containing unconfined shallow groundwater that is at risk of contamination from land use. Within Zone 1 three sub-zones are identified:(a) Zone 1A Christchurch International Airport;(b) Zone 1B existing business areas; and(c) Zone 1C mineral extraction.Zone 2 comprises the existing urban area between Johns and Russley Roads, Marshlands Road and the base of the Port Hills.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

NRRP Waitaki Catchment Regional Allocation Plan	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7529-nrrp-waitaki-catchment-regional-allocation-plan/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>Water Conservation Order: Any person may apply to the Minister for the Environment for a Water Conservation Order. An order aims to recognise the outstanding amenity or intrinsic values that water provides, in either a natural or modified state. Orders may be applied over rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, wetlands, or aquifers, and can cover freshwater or geothermal water. If granted by the Minister, a Water Conservation Order can restrict or prohibit water â€˜takesâ€™, discharges and other uses of the water. Water Conservation Orders can be used to preserve that natural state or protect characteristics such as: the water body's value as a habitat or fishery its wild and scenic nature its value for recreational, historic, spiritual, cultural or scenic purposes. A water body may also hold particular significance for Maori. Applications to the Minister must set out the reasons for the application. If the Minister accepts the application then he or she must appoint a special tribunal to hear and report on the application. The special tribunal then publicly notifies the application and calls for submissions. Submissions must be lodged within 20 working days of the public notice unless a later date is set. Any person may make a submission to the special tribunal. The tribunal then holds a hearing and prepares a report on the application, which will include either a draft Water Conservation Order or a recommendation that the application be declined. This report is sent to the applicant, the Minister, the relevant local and iwi authorities, and every submitter. Anyone who made a submission has a further right of submission to the Environment Court on the special tribunal's report. The Environment Court must hold an inquiry if it receives one or more submissions. If there is such an application to the Environment Court, once it has completed its inquiry, the Environment Court makes a report to the Minister recommending that the special tribunal's report be accepted or rejected with or without modifications. The Minister must make a recommendation to the Governor-General in accordance with the report of the special tribunal or, if the Environment Court has held an inquiry, the report of the Environment Court. If a Water Conservation Order is recommended, the Governor-General then makes the order â€” by order in council. An order can prohibit or restrict a regional council issuing new water and discharge permits, although it can not affect existing permits. Regional policy statements, regional plans and district plans must be consistent with the provisions of a Water Conservation Order.

NRRP Water Quality Management Units Lakes	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7530-nrrp-water-quality-management-units-lakes/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>Water management units and water quality classes(Refer Chapter 4: Schedule WQL1 and Rules WQL1, WQL4, WQL7, WQL8, WQL21, WQL48)Water management units have been developed for all river and lakes outside the natural state areas, excluding rivers and lakes covered by the operative Opihi River, and Waimakariri River regional plans.  For lakes the management units are based on the location of the lake in either high country or coastal areas, with separate units for artificial lakes either on a river or off river.Water quality and bed substrate outcomes for each management unit are set out in the tables in Objective WQL1. The outcomes take into account geology and location of the river or lake and other influences on water quality such as land use and the contribution from tributaries.Major lake and pond featrues that have been classified as part of the River Environment Classification by NIWA. Modified by ECAN to include some reclassified units. Features were classifed as part of The Natural Resources Regional Plan for bother Water Quality, and Lake Type. Water quality classes have been defined for all rivers and lakes in the Canterbury region, excluding the areas covered by the operative Opihi and Proposed Waimakariri River regional plans and the Ahuriri River and Rakaia River water conservation orders.

NRRP Water Quality Management Units Rivers	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7531-nrrp-water-quality-management-units-rivers/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>Water management units and water quality classes(Refer Chapter 4: Schedule WQL1 and Rules WQL1, WQL4, WQL7, WQL8, WQL21, WQL48)Water management units have been developed for all river and lakes outside the natural state areas, excluding rivers and lakes covered by the operative Opihi River, and Waimakariri River regional plans. For rivers, the management units are based on the source of the river flow, and additionally for some rivers, whether they are located in the upland or lowland areas of the region. For lakes the management units are based on the location of the lake in either high country or coastal areas, with separate units for artificial lakes either on a river or off river.Water quality and bed substrate outcomes for each management unit are set out in the tables in Objective WQL1. The outcomes take into account geology and location of the river or lake and other influences on water quality such as land use and the contribution from tributaries. Water quality classes have been defined for rivers and lakes in the natural state areas and for each water management unit. all rivers and lakes in the Canterbury region, excluding the areas covered by the operative Opihi and Proposed Waimakariri River regional plans and the Ahuriri River and Rakaia River water conservation orders. A water quality class has the same name as the corresponding water management unit.

NZ Area Codes for recording specimen localities	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/165-nz-area-codes-for-recording-specimen-localities/	Landcare Research	<p>Crosby et al. (1976) subdivided the New Zealand mainland (North, South, and Stewart Islands, plus nearby inshore islands) into 29 approximately equalsized areas, and defined two-letter codes for each. The codes and boundary definitions for these areas were provided on a separate, large map enclosed with the journal issue. These areas were modified from the areas used as weather forecast districts by the New Zealand Meteorological Service, and their main purpose was to facilitate the arrangement, retrieval, and documentation of specimens in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection (NZAC). The codes have subsequently been used in other collections, for computer databases, and in publications as a convenient way of categorising specimen data.<br /></p><p>The New Zealand Journal of Zoology paper is provided here as an attachment to this record and is available for download.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Landcare Data Use License

NZ Geodetic Marks	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/787-nz-geodetic-marks/	Land Information New Zealand	<p>This dataset provides information about the position, position accuracy, mark name, mark type, condition and unique four letter code for geodetic marks in terms of a New Zealand's official geodetic datum. </p><p>The dataset only contains marks that are within the New Zealand mainland and offshore islands. These positions have been generated using geodetic observations such as precise differential GPS or electronic distance and theodolite angles measurements. The positions are either 2D or 3D depending of the availability of this measurement data. </p><p>The source data is from Land Information New Zealand's (LINZ) Landonline system where it is used by Land Surveyors. This dataset is updated daily to reflect changes made in the Landonline.</p><h4>Accuracy</h4><p>Geodetic marks with a coordinate order of 5 or less have been positioned in terms of NZGD2000. Lower order marks (order 6 and greater) are derived from cadastral surveys, lower accuracy measurement techniques or inaccurate historical datum transformations, and may be significantly less accurate. </p><p>The accuracy of NZGD2000 coordinates is described by a series of 'orders' classifications. Positions in terms of NZGD2000 are described by three-dimensional coordinates (latitude, longitude, ellipsoidal height). The accuracy of a survey mark is indicated by its Order. Orders are classifications based on the quality of the coordinate in relation to the datum and in relation to other surrounding marks. For more information see <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heights/heights/coordinate-orders/">www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heigh...</a> </p><p>Note that the accuracy applies at the time the mark was last surveyed. Refer to the web geodetic database for historical information about mark coordinates. </p><p>Note also that the existence of a mark in this dataset does not imply that there is currently a physical mark in the ground - the dataset includes destroyed or lost historical marks. The geodetic database provides more information on the mark status, valid at last time it was visited by LINZ or a maintenance contractor.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

NZGeoid2009 can also be used to transform heights to any of the 13 official local vertical datums used across New Zealand, more information on this transformation is available at <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/conversion-coordinates/height-conversions">www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/conversion-coordinates/h...</a>.<br /></p><p>NZGeoid2009 is formally defined in the LINZ standard LINZS25004 which can be obtained from <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/standards-publications/standards">www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/standards-publications/s...</a>.  NZGeoid2009 models the difference between the GRS80 ellipsoid and the geoid over the New Zealand region.  The geoid is a theoretical surface of equal gravity that roughly approximates the mean level of the sea across the Earth.<br /></p><p>NZGeoid2009 is published by LINZ and was computed by enhancing the EGM2008 global gravity model with terrestrial gravity observations over New Zealand and DNSC08 satellite altimetry data over the oceans.  The model is published on a one arc-minute grid covering New Zealand's extended exclusive economic zone.<br /></p><p>The accuracy of NZGeoid2009 is nominally Â±0.08 metres across New Zealand.

The Landonline system which manages the data maintains non-spatial parcels for many different reasons. The non-spatial parcels can only be accessed via WFS or as a full layer file download. No layer clips can be used. The most common reasons for non-spatial parcels are:</p><ol><li><p>Flats and unit survey plans will create non-spatial parcels for referencing property rights. This is because the Landonline system has not yet been designed to support the spatial definition of these plans.</p></li><li><p>Titles which were not linked to a spatial parcel during the Landonline title conversion project created non-spatial parcel references. As titles are spatially linked many of these non-spatial parcels will be made historic or will be merged with the associated spatial parcel.</p></li></ol><p>Parcels within this layer contain the following status flags:</p><ul><li><p>Approved: The definition of a survey-defined parcel that has been processed and authorised as correct in terms of the survey network.</p></li><li><p>Current: A parcels that has been registered or the parcel is made current by a statutory action against a Legalisation plan.</p></li><li><p>Survey Historic: A parcel that has been extinguished from the primary cadastral network but still exists in live Title estates.</p></li><li><p>Historic: A parcel that has been extinguished from the primary cadastral network and no longer exists in live Title estates or has an current recorded statutory action. Typically this happens when a parcel is subdivided or merged, and new titles or actions are registered against the replacing parcels. Note: Only parcel made historic since the beginning of Landonline operations (2002) are included. See this <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/survey-titles/landonline-data/landonline-bde/related-datasets/dcdb-datasets">page</a> for the actual dates when Landonline operations started.</p></li></ul><p>The Linear parcels within this layer has a nominal accuracy of 0.1-1m in urban areas and 1-100m in rural areas. For more detailed information about parcel accuracies please refer to the <a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/774-nz-survey-boundary-marks">Survey Boundary Marks</a> layer which contains accuracies for each parcel node. </p><p>The originating data for parcel/title associations includes some non-official sources where the official data does not support a link.

This is because the Landonline system has not yet been designed to support the spatial definition of these plans.</p></li><li><p>Titles which were not linked to a spatial parcel during the Landonline title conversion project created non-spatial parcel references. As titles are spatially linked many of these non-spatial parcels will be made historic or will be merged with the associated spatial parcel.</p></li></ol><p>Parcels within this layer contain the following status flags:</p><ul><li><p>Approved: The definition of a survey-defined parcel that has been processed and authorised as correct in terms of the survey network.</p></li><li><p>Current: A parcels that has been registered or the parcel is made current by a statutory action against a Legalisation plan.</p></li><li><p>Survey Historic: A parcel that has been extinguished from the primary cadastral network but still exists in live Title estates.</p></li><li><p>Historic: A parcel that has been extinguished from the primary cadastral network and no longer exists in live Title estates or has an current recorded statutory action. Typically this happens when a parcel is subdivided or merged, and new titles or actions are registered against the replacing parcels. Note: Only parcel made historic since the beginning of Landonline operations (2002) are included.See this <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/survey-titles/landonline-data/landonline-bde/related-datasets/dcdb-datasets">page</a> for the actual dates when Landonline operations started.</p></li></ul><p>Polygons within this layer have a nominal accuracy of 0.1-1m in urban areas and 1-100m in rural areas.

NZ Road Centre Line (Electoral)	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/818-nz-road-centre-line-electoral/	Land Information New Zealand	<p>This source Landonline data exists in order to provide linear geometries against which official road names and street addresses can be recorded. Its purpose is also to enable automated meshblock address reports (for electoral and statistical purposes) so as to identify the presence of a road name in meshblocks where street addresses do not exist. </p><p>A road centreline in this layer will typically consist of several road centreline geometries from Landonline that have been associated to the same road name.<br />In Landonline a road name is commonly assigned to multiple stretches of roading such as between intersections with other roads. A road name is also commonly duplicated across the country e.g. "Queen Street", "High street" etc. </p><p>For this layer (as opposed to the Road Subsections Layer. Individual road sections have been aggregated to a single road centreline geometry for each locality. Thus, for example, State Highway 1 has individual sections for differing towns and whenever it crosses a Territorial Authority boundary. </p><p>Because some roads have multiple names for part of their lengths, some road centreline geometries will duplicate parts of other roads even though there is in reality only one road formation. </p><p>The road centrelines recorded in Landonline do not represent actual road formation, nor do they represent legal access. They must not be considered as topographic, cadastral, or legal. </p><p>As a general rule those that are not within a Road Parcels Layer should be treated as being of highly variable accuracy. They do however meet the purposes for which they have been captured, and can provide a valuable resource for other purposes provided that the user(s) understand their origin and consequential limitations. </p><p>Warning:<br />The purpose of the location field is to enable differentiation between roads of the same name in the dataset.

NZ Road Centre Line Subsections (Electoral)	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/793-nz-road-centre-line-subsections-electoral/	Land Information New Zealand	<p>This layer provides a feature representing Electoral road subsection (e.g. a city block) to which associated data such electoral addresses can be attached. </p><p>In Landonline a road name is commonly assigned to multiple stretches of roading such as between intersections with other roads. For this layer each of these individual road sections have their own geometry (as opposed to the Road Centre Line Layer where they have been aggregated). </p><p>A road may also have more than one road name, some road centreline geometries will duplicate other roads subsections even though there is in reality only one road formation. In addition, a road name is also commonly duplicated across the country e.g. "Queen Street", "High street" etc </p><p>The source Landonline data exists in order to provide linear geometries against which official road names and street addresses can be recorded. Its purpose is also to enable automated meshblock address reports (for electoral and statistical purposes) so as to identify the presence of a road name in meshblocks where street addresses do not exist. </p><p>The road centrelines recorded in Landonline do not represent actual road formation, nor do they represent legal access. They must not be considered as topographic, cadastral, or legal. </p><p>As a general rule those that are not within a Road Parcels Layer should be treated as being of highly variable accuracy. They do however meet the purposes for which they have been captured, and can provide a valuable resource for other purposes provided that the user(s) understand their origin and consequential limitations. </p><p>Warning: The purpose of the location field is to enable differentiation between roads of the same name in the dataset. It should not be considered official nor part of a valid postal address. It can however be used as an indicative guide to location within a Territorial Authority, or in the case of regional road networks, as an indicative guide to location within New Zealand.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

NZ SPI Adjustments	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/835-nz-spi-adjustments/	Land Information New Zealand	<p>This layer provides the extents of the data incorporated into an adjustment which has been completed as part of the Spatial Parcel Improvement (SPI) project. The SPI project aims to improve the accuracy of digital cadastral data in areas (primarily rural) where survey-accurate data does not currently exist. The improvement of coordinates is controlled by a mathematical adjustment process using a Least Squares methodology. The adjustment/integration process results in increased mapping accuracy of surrounding spatial objects (e.g. parcels), the effect of which is some new observations or parcels appear to move. The extent of the change largely depends upon the accuracy of the underlying data. In general, movements will be at least several metres, as the SPI project targets areas where significant movements are expected.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

NZ Street Address (Electoral)	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/779-nz-street-address-electoral/	Land Information New Zealand	<p>This layer provides all allocated addresses as advised to LINZ by Territorial Authorities (TAs).  Under the Local Government Act 1974 (section 319) it is the responsibility of the TAs to advise LINZ (the Surveyor General) of all allocated addresses in their district.<br /></p><hr /><p>Local Government Act 1974<br /><strong>319B Allocation of property numbers</strong><br />(1) For electoral, postal, and other purposes the council may allocate a number to any area of land or building or part of a building within its district and may change the number allocated to any such area of land or building.<br />(2) The council shall comply with any request from a Chief Surveyor to allocate a number to or change the number of any area of land or building or part of a building in its district.<br />(3) The principal administrative officer shall advise the Chief Surveyor of the land district in which the land or building is situated of the numbers allocated under subsection (1) or subsection (2).<br /></p><hr /><p>Generally allocated addresses will be represented by a single point.  However there was an historical practice to represent only the principal address allocated by Territorial Authorities, and not include addresses assigned to individual flats.  Similarly there was an historical practice to aggregate addresses into ranges, especially where there are many addresses for a single parcel. We are working (where possible) to resolve these historical anomalies and have each allocated address represented where possible.  The datasets also includes addresses where the Surveyor General has requested (under the Local Government Act) that a TA allocated an address.<br /></p><p>The road name and locality fields attributed to an address are taken from the associated road attributes.  These roads are stored as centrelines (see NZ Road Centre Line (Electoral)) and reflect the road names as assigned by the TA responsible.  The locality name ensures that if duplicate road names exist in TA that the number/road combination can still be unique by using the locality field.<br /></p><p>Wherever address points have been provided in spatial data files by a TA, LINZ will import this data and use the exact location as defined by the TA.  Where non spatial data is provided LINZ adds the location of an address point with the mandatory priority to locate that address point within the correct meshblock. The location of the front door of an elector's dwelling within the correct meshblock is a fundamental requirement of the electoral system (Section 72 Electoral Act 1993).  Highly desirable priorities for the location of an address point are to have it in the same property and parcel as the dwelling and on the correct side of the physical and legal roads. It is also a desirable priority to have the address point in the same location as the dwelling and/or at the location of the property entrance.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

It was intended to "back-capture" approximately 70 percent of existing parcels, which equates to about 20 percent of the land area of New Zealand.</p><p>The data capture known as "Populate Electronic Parcel" (PEP) was undertaken under contract by EDS.</p><p>The areas to be captured known as "Survey Capture Areas" (SCA) were defined in consultation with local LINZ staff, survey practitioners and Local Authorities.</p><p>Within the defined SCAs, the dimensions for surveyed right-lined boundaries of current parcels were captured from existing survey plans. In addition, sufficient traverses, boundary ties, and connections to the geodetic control were captured or surveyed to ensure adequate network geometry and strengthen areas where the boundary dimensions are unreliable. This survey network was adjusted to generate modern survey coordinates for all relevant nodes. Where the resulting boundaries comply with the accuracy requirements of the 1998 Survey Regulations, then the adjusted co-ordinates were declared to have SDC (Survey-accurate Digital Cadastre) status.</p><p>For more information see <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/survey-titles/landonline-data/landonline-bde/related-datasets/dcdb-datasets/survey-conversion">here</a></p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

The control_network field within this layer records this network with the 3 or 4 letter abbreviation code as follows:</p><pre><code>NRF  - National Reference Frame  NDMN - National Deformation Monitoring Network  RDMN - Regional Deformation Monitoring Network  LDMN - Local Deformation Monitoring Network  CHN  - Cadastral Horizontal Control Network  CVN  - Cadastral Vertical Control Network  BGN  - Basic Geospatial Network  NHN  - National Height Network</code></pre><p>Note a geodetic mark can be in more than network. Also not all geodetic marks are currently associated with a geodetic network. Those that are may be referred to as a control mark. For more information about the control networks refer to <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/geodetic-programme/survey-control-networks/">www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/geodetic-programme/surve...</a>. </p><h4>Accuracy</h4><p>Geodetic marks with a coordinate order of 5 or less have been positioned in terms of NZGD2000. Lower order marks (order 6 and greater) are derived from cadastral surveys, lower accuracy measurement techniques or inaccurate historical datum transformations, and may be significantly less accurate. </p><p>The accuracy of NZGD2000 coordinates is described by a series of 'orders' classifications. Positions in terms of NZGD2000 are described by three-dimensional coordinates (latitude, longitude, ellipsoidal height). The accuracy of a survey mark is indicated by its order. Orders are classifications based on the quality of the coordinate in relation to the datum and in relation to other surrounding marks. For more information see <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heights/heights/coordinate-orders/">www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heigh...</a> </p><p>Note that the accuracy applies at the time the mark was last surveyed. Refer to the web geodetic database for historical information about mark coordinates. </p><p>Note also that the existence of a mark in this dataset does not imply that there is currently a physical mark in the ground - the dataset includes destroyed or lost historical marks. The geodetic database provides more information on the mark status, valid at last time it was visited by LINZ or a maintenance contractor.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence
NZ Survey Non-Boundary Marks	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/776-nz-survey-non-boundary-marks/	Land Information New Zealand	<p>This layer provides survey mark information for marks that are not part of a parcel </p><p>A non-boundary mark is any survey mark that is not on a boundary point. The points in this dataset represent physical survey monuments usually placed for cadastral requirements. The data set also includes geodetic marks. Non-boundary marks now enter the Landonline system predominately as part of a cadastral survey dataset (plan) and occasionally via the geodetic processes. For Cadastral marks (i.e.the majority) its name consists of a mark type and number (and is unique to that survey), followed by the â€˜planâ€™ number e.g. IS I DP 3456; IS II DP3456. </p><p>Note:<br />Non-boundary marks used to connect cadastral surveys to the geodetic network are those of 6th order (or better) and this subset is available as the NZ Cadastral Survey Network Marks layer. </p><p>This dataset extends the Landonline stored data by including the network accuracy which is based upon its assigned Landonline order - refer LINZS25006 (<a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/news-publications-and-consultations/search-for-regulatory-documents/DocumentSummary.aspx?document=256">www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/news-publications-and-...</a>). </p><p>The accuracy provided relates to the accuracy of coordinates of the mark and has little relevance to the accuracy of the boundary in relation to other boundaries. For example, if the coordinates of the mark were used to locate it, a user would expect to find the existing mark within the accuracy (distance) stated.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

NZ WACA Adjustments	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/836-nz-waca-adjustments/	Land Information New Zealand	<p>This layer provides the extents of the data incorporated into an adjustment which has been completed as a Wide Area Cadastral Adjustment (WACA). These adjustments are undertaken in areas where there is already substantial survey-accurate data, but there are some inconsistencies in the data resulting from small changes to geodetic control coordinates and/or the progressive submission of additional Cadastral Survey Datasets (CSDs). The improvement of coordinates is controlled by a mathematical adjustment process using a Least Squares methodology. The adjustment/integration process results in increased mapping accuracy of surrounding spatial objects (e.g. parcels), the effect of which is some new observations or parcels appear to move. The extent of the change largely depends upon the accuracy of the underlying data. In general, movements will be no more than 10cm, as the WACAs target areas where coordinates already have fairly high spatial accuracy.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

NZDF Personnel File List	http://archives.govt.nz/has/open-data/nzdf-personnel-file-list	Department of Internal Affairs	Archives New Zealand holds over 140,000 military personnel files of those who served in the New Zealand Defence Forces up to the end of 1920, including the South African War and WWI.  These records were transferred from various NZDF agencies over recent years, with about 29 transfers from NZDF Personnel Archives in the last decade.As each transfer was completed the data format and logic sequence was maintained within each accession as part of the process.  Records were also processed to link to various agencies, and categorised into different series by the nature of the record and their relationships.  This means the NZDF personnel files are dispersed into various series and accessions, and to access all of these records users need to have in-depth knowledge about the evolution of NZDF and about how archives are managed.This list aims to help people overcome the above obstacles through standardising the format of names and sorting all entries into a unique sequence (alphabetical order by surname) across all transfers of NZDF personnel files, which will support the most simple and common access path to these records by users.NZDF personnel files are composed of the original personnel files, military history sheets, and microfilm strip copies of original personnel files that were destroyed after microfilming in the 1970s.

NZGD2000 deformation model version 2013-08-01 reverse patch coordinate shifts contours	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/1684-nzgd2000-deformation-model-version-2013-08-01-reverse-patch-coordinate-shifts-contours/	Land Information New Zealand	<p>The deformation model associated with the NZGD2000 datum was updated, nominally at 1 August 2013.  The actual update of LINZ data took place on 14-15 December 2013. This update involved reverse patches, which means that the "reference coordinates" of features were updated.  The main updates relate to the Christchurch earthquakes.  The patch also updated coordinates affected by other South Island earthquakes since 2000.</p><p>These updates have been incorporated into Landonline and resulted in spatial updates to all features in the affected areas.</p><p>This data set contains contours indicating the extent and magnitude of the coordinate changes to assist in assessing the impact of this update on client data sets.

In New Zealandâ€™s case the continental margin extends beyond the EEZ in many places and the outer limits have been established on the basis of the recommendations of the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. Under UNCLOS, New Zealand exercises sovereign rights over the continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.</p><p>Note: The boundary includes, where applicable, the delimitation of the boundaries of the continental shelf with Australia under the treaty of 25 July 2004. The delimitation of the maritime boundaries in the north with Fiji, Tonga and possibly France in respect of New Caledonia, have yet to be settled by treaty.</p><p>Maritime Boundary Definitions:<br /><a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/nautical-info/maritime-boundaries/definitions#zones">www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/nautical-info/maritime-boun...</a></p><p>Further References:<br /><a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/nautical-info/maritime-boundaries">www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/nautical-info/maritime-boun...</a></p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators 2011	http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/new-zealand-maternity-clinical-indicators-2011	Ministry of Health	The New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators are the result of collaboration between the Ministry of Health and maternity stakeholders, representing consumer, midwifery, obstetric, general practice, paediatric and anaesthetic perspectives. Building on previous work undertaken across Australasia, an expert working group has established a set of 12 maternity clinical indicators that are relevant to the New Zealand setting and can be measured using available data collections. This third report presents data for 2011 using the same standardised definitions as in the previous two reports (2009 and 2010).  This is also the third report using the standard primipara definition which allows the separate assessment of a group of women for whom interventions and outcomes should be similar. In addition to eight indicators for standard primiparae, there are three indicators for all women giving birth in hospital and one indicator covering all babies born in hospital. This report provides an opportunity for district health boards (DHBs) and local maternity stakeholders to identify areas for further investigation at a local level as part of local maternity quality and safety programmes. A time series view of three years of indicators data as an interactive dataset accompanies this third report and enables analysis of local and national trends over time.

New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators 2012	http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/new-zealand-maternity-clinical-indicators-2012	Ministry of Health	The New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators are the result of collaboration between the Ministry of Health and maternity stakeholders representing consumer, midwifery, obstetric, general practice, paediatric, and anaesthetic perspectives. In 2011 an expert working group established a set of 12 maternity clinical indicators that could be measured using the available data collections at that time.In 2013 the National Maternity Monitoring Group reviewed the original indicator set and recommended a range of changes to improve the quality, completeness and scope of the New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators. These proposed changes were further reviewed and developed by the original expert working group to ensure the objectives of the New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators were retained; that being a tool for assessing the quality and national consistency in the delivery of maternity services in New Zealand.This report presents the first year of these revised indicators. In addition to improved quality and completeness of the existing 12 indicators, three new indicators have been added that reflect care during pregnancy and the postnatal period and severe maternal morbidity.

New Zealand Potential Vegetation (Grid version)	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/279-new-zealand-potential-vegetation-grid-version/	Landcare Research	<p>New Zealand's potential forest composition was predicted from regressions relating the distributions of major canopy tree species to environment. Environmental variables, chosen for their correspondence to major tree physiological processes, included annual and seasonal temperature and solar radiation, soil and atmospheric water deficit, soil leaching, slope, and soil parent material and drainage. Environmental values were estimaged both for a large set of irregularly distributed plots describing forest composition, and points on a 1-km grid across New Zealand. Regressions were fitted to the ploy data species by species, with those for the four Nothofagus species also including terms to correct for the effects of their geographic disjunctions. Predictions of species abundance were then made for the grid data set, and the resulting matrix was classified to derive groups of similar composition. This data is expected to provide a context for both the assessment of the biodiversity value of surviving forest remnants and for the subsequent management and/or restoration of these sites.</p>	other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Other licensing (check with source agency)

New Zealand’s 100 highest-risk intersections	http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/high-risk-intersections-guide/	New Zealand Transport Agency	The list of 100 intersections will help the NZ Transport Agency and its road controlling authority partners better manage the local risk so they can target safety improvements (countermeasures) to where they’re most needed and help reduce crashes, save lives and prevent injuries.The high-risk intersection list has been compiled by the NZ Transport Agency, with input from local authorities, by using guidelines developed in 2013 to provide a nationally consistent method of assessing crash data to identify intersection crash risks. Crash figures were analysed for the ten years from 2003 to 2012, with 53 deaths and 445 serious injuries recorded at the 100 highest-risk intersections over that period.A high-risk intersection is an intersection where it is likely that there will be fatal and serious crashes which could be prevented by effective countermeasures.

Norway Rat distribution in Northland (1 July 2007)	http://koordinates.com/layer/1608-norway-rat-distribution-in-northland-1-july-2007/	Department of Conservation	<p>This dataset represents the terrestrial distribution of Norway Rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Northland as at 1 July 2007.  It represents this species' final layer as part of the Natural Heritage Management Strategy of the Department of Conservation.<br /></p><p>Spatial and textual data were collected at the Area level by Department of Conservation Area Office and Conservancy Office staff.  Polygons representing the distribution were hand-drawn onto LINZ 260 series topo maps at the 1:250,000 scale.  Digitisation of the hand-drawn maps was contracted to Geographx (NZ) Limited.<br /></p><p>Freshwater lakes, ponds and rivers were clipped from the layer to represent species absence. Further digitisation work was carried out by the DOC R&D GIS team in Christchurch to re-define selected polygons by species specific distribution drivers; i.e. altitude and habitat guided by LCBD 2.  The attribute table may contain references to quantitative datasets of species abundance (where such datasets exist).<br /></p><p>For full explanation of data collection methodology see DOCDM-186114.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

Potential Vegetation of New Zealand	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/289-potential-vegetation-of-new-zealand/	Landcare Research	<p>New Zealand's potential forest composition was predicted from regressions relating the distributions of major canopy tree species to environment. Environmental variables, chosen for their correspondence to major tree physiological processes, included annual and seasonal temperature and solar radiation, soil and atmospheric water deficit, soil leaching, slope, and soil parent material and drainage. Environmental values were estimaged both for a large set of irregularly distributed plots describing forest composition, and points on a 1-km grid across New Zealand. Regressions were fitted to the ploy data species by species, with those for the four Nothofagus species also including terms to correct for the effects of their geographic disjunctions. Predictions of species abundance were then made for the grid data set, and the resulting matrix was classified to derive groups of similar composition. This data is expected to provide a context for both the assessment of the biodiversity value of surviving forest remnants and for the subsequent management and/or restoration of these sites.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Landcare Data Use License

Rabbit distribution in Northland (1 July 2007)	http://koordinates.com/layer/1610-rabbit-distribution-in-northland-1-july-2007/	Department of Conservation	<p>This dataset represents the terrestrial distribution of Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus) in Northland as at 1 July 2007.  It represents this species' final layer as part of the Natural Heritage Management Strategy of the Department of Conservation.<br /></p><p>Spatial and textual data were collected at the Area level by Department of Conservation Area Office and Conservancy Office staff.  Polygons representing the distribution were hand-drawn onto LINZ 260 series topo maps at the 1:250,000 scale.  Digitisation of the hand-drawn maps was contracted to Geographx (NZ) Limited.<br /></p><p>Freshwater lakes, ponds and rivers were clipped from the layer to represent species absence. Further digitisation work was carried out by the DOC R&D GIS team in Christchurch to re-define selected polygons by species specific distribution drivers; i.e. altitude and habitat guided by LCBD 2.  The attribute table may contain references to quantitative datasets of species abundance (where such datasets exist).<br /></p><p>For full explanation of data collection methodology see DOCDM-186114.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

This is an area where it may be possible to grant additional shallow groundwater takes, without causing any significant cumulative adverse effects.  However this does not preclude the need for consent applicants to assess stream depletion effects as per Schedule WQN7 of Chapter 5 of the proposed Natural Resources Regional Plan (NRRP).</p><p>On 30 May 2005 the Councilâ€™s Water Allocation Panel (WAP) accepted a staff recommendation to formally recognise the Rakaia Riparian  sub-zone.  At this stage it is not intended to create a formal "sub-zone" within the Chertsey and Rakaia-Selwyn Zones (and recalculate allocation limits), this may be pursued at some future stage through a variation to the NRRP.  In the meantime any consents granted within the new sub-area will be counted as part of the "parent" zone.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

Regional Wetlands	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7614-regional-wetlands/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>The FENZ geodatabase provide a set of spatial layers describing environmental and biological patterns in New Zealandâ€™s freshwater ecosystems - rivers and streams, lakes and wetlands. The FENZ wetlands layer is focused on freshwater palustrine wetlands and standing waterbodies with a 500 m maximum length. It does not include estuarine, marine, riverine and lacustrine hydrosystems because these are (or will be) the focus of analogous classification and ranking projects.In 2003 Environment Canterbury provided the Department of Conservation with existing regional wetland survey information of the 1980s and 1990s, collated into a GIS database and report (Davis 1999). This, together with information from other national database's was checked against satellite imagery collected between September 1999 and 2003 to complete delineation of wetland extent. The baseline for â€˜currentâ€™ wetland extent in the FENZ wetland spatial layer is therefore 1999-2003. Coastal wetland vegetation/habitats were field surveyed, mapped onto aerial photographs, described and entered into a GIS database over the period 2004-2011. Mapped wetlands were described following the hierarchical classification system developed by Johnson and Gerbeaux (2004), which in turn drew on the wetland classification of Clarkson et al. (2003) and the vegetation/habitat mapping and description system of Atkinson (1985). 58 ground-surveyed coastal wetland areas are delimited in the Regional Wetland GIS database. A survey-dated description of each wetland, together with assessments of wetland condition, threats and ecological significance, is provided in the attributes table. The system of field survey and database reporting developed for the regionâ€™s coastal wetland habitats will now be applied to inland freshwater wetlands. Ground-based survey will be carried out to add to, update or improve delineation of wetland areas derived from FENZ, as well as provide a similar level of information on wetland class, vegetation type and overall ecological condition. Results of future wetland survey, ecological description and significance assessment will progressively be added to the Regional Wetland Database.ReferencesAtkinson, I.A.E. 1985.

The Plant Names Database lists over 36,000 names, including synonyms and incorrectly applied names. The database indicates which of the names are preferred for use at the Allan Herbarium (CHR), and provides information on the biostatus and the authorship of the taxa. It contains data for lichens, liverworts, hornworts, mosses, ferns, freshwater algae and seed plants in New Zealand. The Specimen Database is used to store and retrieve herbarium specimen information and to generate specimen labels. It currently contains over 150,000 records, or approximately 25% of the specimens in the herbarium. Information from the Plant Names Database and parts of the Specimen Database are available online at Nga Tipu Aotearoa - New Zealand Plants.<br /><br />The All New Zealand Species Database contains a list of all vascular plant species recorded as present in New Zealand. The database currently lists records for approximately 28 000 species and 7000 synonyms. These records are derived from a wide range of sources including the Allan Herbarium, horticultural societies, nursery catalogues, botanic gardens, arboreta, and published literature. This database is mainly used by the Plant Biodiversity and Biosecurity Information Services as a tool to help determine whether a species has been recorded in New Zealand.	online database	Other-Unknown	Unknown	Other licensing (check with source agency)

Reserve Potassium	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/169-reserve-potassium/	Landcare Research	<p>Reserve potassium (Kc) is a measure how much potassium is available to plants. There are three potassium pools: dissolved, extractable, and reserve potassium. Potassium (K) is continuously drawn from the extractable to the dissolved pool when it is used by plants, and likewise from the reserve pool to the extractable pool. The reserve potassium is held in minerals in the soil such as mica. An example of the utility of this information is for organic farmers, who are not allowed to add potassium chloride to their soils (they can add potassium sulphate, but this is much more expensive). Class 3 for Kc will indicate where organic farming is practical. If you zoom in on the map and click on a soil area it will show the Kc class (pot class). The classes are:<br /></p><p>0 No data<br />1 Low    (0-0.3   cmolK/kg)<br />2 Medium (0.3-0.6 cmolK/kg<br />3 High   (>0.6    cmolK/kg)<br />4 Lakes<br />5 Alpine<br />6 Urban<br /></p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Landcare Data Use License

River Type	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7527-river-type/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>This layer was originally derived from NIWA's River Environment Classification which was modified as per Environment Canterbury's requirements (mainly related stream and river flow paths in flatter areas such as on the Canterbury Plains) for the Proposed Canterbury Natural Resources Regional Plan (NRRP). Note that the representation of a stream or river centreline in the units of this layer may not exactly align with the ground path of an actual water body. Units on this layer that seem to unexpectantly end are assumed to go subsurface. Water quality classes (as listed in the field Unit_WQ) Water quality classes have been defined for all rivers and lakes in the Canterbury region, excluding the areas covered by the operative Opihi and Proposed Waimakariri River regional plans and the Ahuriri River and Rakaia River water conservation orders. Each water quality class contains standards for water quality that are to be achieved for a point source discharge into a river or lake, after mixing of the discharge with the receiving water, in a defined zone. Field Value Display Name AOI;INL - Inland NAT - Natural ALP - Alpine HIL - Hill LOW - Lowland URB - Urban VOL - Volcanic AHU;WAI;RAK;OPI - Rivers and streams within areas covered by the Ahuriri & Rakaia River Water Conservation Order's, and the Opihi River & Proposed Waimakariri River Regional Plans.River and lake types (as listed in the field Unit_V6) The rivers and lakes of the Canterbury region have been grouped into different types that have similar physical and hydrological characteristics. The key physical characteristics that have been used to distinguish the different types of rivers and lakes include: flow, source and flow regime, morphology of rivers (shape), and water levels, size and depth of lakes. These characteristics influence the water quality of these water bodies, their associated aquatic ecosystems, and riparian margins. The objectives of Chapter 4 of the NRRP establish water quality outcomes for each of the river and lake types in the region. Chapter 5, Policy WQN4 provides indicator stream values to be considered when setting flow and level regimes for different river types in the region.

The fundamental soil properties are depth (diggability), depth to slowly permeable layer, rooting depth, rooting barrier, horizon thickness, stoniness, clay and sand content. They are developed from sample information and expert knowledge. The derived soil layers are each based on a model (or pedo-transfer function). Some models are simple lookup tables that depend only on the soil class. Others combine various soil, land use, vegetation, climate or topographic attributes in a mathematical formula. Derived layers will include available water (mm), macroporosity, water retention, bulk density, total carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, cation exchange capacity, pH, and phosphorus retention.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Landcare Data Use License

Derived layers will include available water (mm), macroporosity, water retention, bulk density, total carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, cation exchange capacity, pH, and phosphorus retention.July 2014 changes: New areas that have been added to S-map Online include the lowlands in Otago/Southland, Hanmer Basin, Greymouth-Hokitika, and Cheviot to Kaikoura. There is also new mapping in the Manawatu and around Otaki.The Profile Available Water (PAW) pedo-transfer function has been further improved. This has resulted in revised PAW estimates for all soils, and changes to some risk categories. The Overseer fields on the factsheets have been updated. The S-map reference name now has an additional character e.g. Raka_3.1 is now Raka_3a.1. Various minor corrections have been made to the data and factsheets.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Landcare Data Use License

Each soil family is defined as a unique combination of attributes (NZSC classification, parent material, rock type, dominant texture and permeability class). Soil classes are further characterised as siblings according to their depth to rock class, stoniness, land type, drainage, texture (more detailed), functional horizons and miscellaneous variant information. The uncertainty of each of these family and sibling attribute classes is specified.  Associated with the soil class layer will be additional map layers of fundamental and derived soil properties. The fundamental soil properties are depth (diggability), depth to slowly permeable layer, rooting depth, rooting barrier, horizon thickness, stoniness, clay and sand content. They are developed from sample information and expert knowledge. The derived soil layers are each based on a model (or pedo-transfer function).

Based from Schedule WQN14 Chapter 5 of the NRRP.Grid References were converted to NZTM2000 to make upstream and downstream extent markers. LINZ NZTopo50 River data was used as a basis to create this feature class.As a number of sites do not have an upstream map reference and instead have a contour that indicates the upper extent of the spawning area. The reason for this is that these streams generally include several tributaries and all are significant. The reference to the contour is intended to capture all tributaries feeding into the stream above its lower reference point.</p><p>Copyright statement: Environment Canterbury</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

Sea Water Inundation Zone Boundary	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/8079-sea-water-inundation-zone-boundary/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>Sea water inundation is defined as the movement of sea water onto the hinterland behind the beach system. Sea water inundations are mainly confined to South Canterbury where approximately 1,000 hectares of land in the Waihao-Wainono, Hook-Makikihi and Washdyke-Seadown-Milford areas have been historically affected. Along the remainder of the regionâ€™s coast, sea water inundation problems have been reported at Rakaia-Taumutu, Leithfield, Amberley, and along sections of the Kaikoura Coast.</p><p>Copyright statement: Environment Canterbury</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

It represents this species' final layer as part of the Natural Heritage Management Strategy of the Department of Conservation.<br /></p><p>Spatial and textual data were collected at the Area level by Department of Conservation Area Office and Conservancy Office staff.  Polygons representing the distribution were hand-drawn onto LINZ 260 series topo maps at the 1:250,000 scale.  Digitisation of the hand-drawn maps was contracted to Geographx (NZ) Limited.<br /></p><p>Freshwater lakes, ponds and rivers were clipped from the layer to represent species absence. Further digitisation work was carried out by the DOC R&D GIS team in Christchurch to re-define selected polygons by species specific distribution drivers; i.e. altitude and habitat guided by LCBD 2.  The attribute table may contain references to quantitative datasets of species abundance (where such datasets exist).<br /></p><p>For full explanation of data collection methodology see DOCDM-186114.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

Tariff classifications & rates	http://www.customs.govt.nz/news/utilities/Pages/tariff-classifications.aspx	New Zealand Customs Service	There are two datasets that can be downloaded via this link. The datasets contain a series of Customs Tariff and Concession data. These datasets are derived from The Working Tariff Document of New Zealand (http://www.customs.govt.nz/news/resources/tariff/Pages/default.aspx) and you can look up this information on this website. An description of each set is given below.Please note that as some of the descriptions in these files could contain a comma, each dataset uses the tilde character ~ as the field delimiter.Tariff DatasetsThe Tariff zip file contains of four .csv files:- Tariff Details, Tariff Rates, Tariff Levies and Tariff Levy Formulas and the time stamp txt file. The Tariff Details, Tariff Rates, Tariff Levies are linked by the tariff item levels 1 - 5. Each tariff item can be read as a whole, e.g. 12.34.56.78.90X but can be broken into 5 levels of 2 numbers each plus a check letter. The levels areChapterHeadingSub-headingItemStatistical key - usually quoted with the check letter, i.e. 90XThe Tariff Details file provides information relating to the tariff item itself giving start and end date, description, check letter and any statistical or supplementary units required. The remaining fields can pretty much be ignored. The Tariff Rates file contains the tariff item, rate group, e.g. lesser developed Countries (LDC), the start and end date for each rate and the formula and factors used to calculate the duty. The Tariff Levies file is similar to the Tariff Rates file but relates to levies for example the ALAC (Alcohol Advisory Council) etc. The rate corresponding to the levy formula is contained in the Tariff Levy Formulas .csv file. The time stamp file contains the date and time the last time these files were updatedConcession DatasetsThe Concession zip file contains of three .csv files:- Concession Details, Concession Rates, Concession to Tariff and the time stamp txt file. The concession files follow the same lines as the Tariff download in that each file is linked by the concession code. The details and rates file follow the same basic principles of the tariff files. The concession to tariff file shows the tariff items that the concession applies to. The use of ** in the concession to tariff file denotes that the concession applies to this whole tariff level e.g. 23 04 ** ** ** means that the concession applies to all tariff heading 2304.

Threatened Environments Classification 2012	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/282-threatened-environments-classification-2012/	Landcare Research	<p>This layer comes from the Threatened Environment Classification (TEC) version 2012, which is a source of national scale background information on New Zealand's land environments. Specifically, it shows how much native (indigenous) vegetation remains within land environments, and how past vegetation loss and legal protection are distributed across New Zealand's landscape. The TEC uses indigenous vegetation as a surrogate for indigenous biodiversity. This includes indigenous ecosystems, habitats and communities: the indigenous species, subspecies and varieties that are supported by indigenous vegetation, and their genetic diversity. The TEC is most appropriately applied to help identify places that are priorities for formal protection against clearance and/or incompatible land-uses, and for ecological restoration to restore lost species, linkages and buffers. The TEC is a combination of three national databases: Land Environments New Zealand (LENZ), classes of the 4th Land Cover Database (LCDB4, based on 2012 satellite imagery) and the protected areas network (version 2012, reflecting areas legally protected for the purpose of natural heritage protection).<br /></p><p>For more information see: Cieraad E, Walker S, Price R, Barringer J. 2015.

Timaru Liquefaction Susceptibility 2013	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7544-timaru-liquefaction-susceptibility-2013/	Canterbury Regional Council	<p>This dataset delineates zones of liquefaction susceptibility. The zones are based on simplified geological groupings. Most of the dataset, outside of Timaru township,is based on the 1:300,000 Timaru district liquefaction potential map (Figure 1) inMcCahon, 2013,Liquefaction Hazard in Timaru District (Environment Canterbury report R13/29)but uses the more accurate boundaries of geological units directly from the GNS Science1:250,000 QMAP geological map shapefile as the zone boundaries.In Timaru township, including the three areas of moderate liquefaction potential and three zones of low potential, the zones are digitised directly from the 1:25,000 Timaru township liquefaction potential map (Figure 2) in the above report, and also from Borelog Location sheets 3 (1:4,000), 4 (1:5,000) and 6 (1:10,000) from Appendix E of the above report. These zones differ from the zones in the 1:300,000 map (Figure 1), and from the 1:250,000 QMAP geological map unit boundaries, but are assumed to be more accurate.</p><p>Copyright statement: Dataset created by Helen Jack, Environment Canterbury, 2013.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

It optimises the cartographic potential of the vegetation information available in the early 1980s and provides a historical record which will aid in future analyses of vegetative cover and land utilisation. The map classification recognises 47 Vegetative Cover Classes identified by alphanumeric code and 17 Vegetative Cover Elements identified (only on the printed map) by symbols and patterns. The map is published as two sheets 730mm x 880mm covering the three principal islands of New Zealand and all offshore islands within 100km of the coast. The map was accompanied by a 153 page, illustrated, book which discusses New Zealand's vegetation and describes the 47 classes.<br /></p><p>The book to accompany this dataset is available as an epub from:<br /><a href="https://mebooks.co.nz/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=402">mebooks.co.nz/index.php?route=product/product&prod...</a> .<br /></p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No	Landcare Data Use License

Vulnerability to Soil Structural Degradation	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/168-vulnerability-to-soil-structural-degradation/	Landcare Research	<p>Untimely cultivation, grazing and forestry operations when the soils are wet give rise to a rapid and marked loss of soil structure and a reduction in soil permeability and aeration owing to the compaction, deformation and consolidation of the topsoil and upper subsoil. This degradation results from the pressure of heavy machinery or treading by stock. Some soils are more at risk than others due to their poor resistance and resilience to compacting forces, poor drainage, limited water holding capacity, or higher rainfall.<br /></p><p>References<br />Parfitt, R.

Weasel distribution in Northland (1 July 2007)	http://koordinates.com/layer/1613-weasel-distribution-in-northland-1-july-2007/	Department of Conservation	<p>This dataset represents the terrestrial distribution of Weasel (Mustela nivalis vulgaris) in Northland as at 1 July 2007.  It represents this species' final layer as part of the Natural Heritage Management Strategy of the Department of Conservation.<br /></p><p>Spatial and textual data were collected at the Area level by Department of Conservation Area Office and Conservancy Office staff.  Polygons representing the distribution were hand-drawn onto LINZ 260 series topo maps at the 1:250,000 scale.  Digitisation of the hand-drawn maps was contracted to Geographx (NZ) Limited.<br /></p><p>Freshwater lakes, ponds and rivers were clipped from the layer to represent species absence. Further digitisation work was carried out by the DOC R&D GIS team in Christchurch to re-define selected polygons by species specific distribution drivers; i.e. altitude and habitat guided by LCBD 2.  The attribute table may contain references to quantitative datasets of species abundance (where such datasets exist).<br /></p><p>For full explanation of data collection methodology see DOCDM-186114.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo	Other-Unknown	No	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence

Women’s Franchise Petitions 1892 and 1893	http://www.digitalnz.org/records?i[content_partner]=Archives+New+Zealand+Te+Rua+Mahara+o+te+K%C4%81wanatanga&i[display_collection]=Shared+Repository	Department of Internal Affairs	When Governor Glasgow signed the Electoral Bill on 19 September 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing nation in the world where women had won the right to vote. The Bill was the outcome of years of meetings in towns and cities across the country, with women often traveling considerable distances to hear lectures and speeches, pass resolutions and sign petitions. A number of petitions were presented to both Houses of Parliament from the early 1880s till 1893. Only two of these historically important documents are known to have survived and both are preserved at Archives New Zealand. The first of these was the unsuccessful 1892 women‘s franchise petition containing approximately 20,000 signatures. This was the culmination of many years work by the Women‘s Christian Temperance Movement and prominent suffragist, Kate Sheppard. Despite the failure of this initial petition, another was organised in 1893, and was described by Kate Sheppard as "a monster petition" demanding the right for women to vote. Petition sheets, circulated throughout New Zealand, were returned to Christchurch where Kate Sheppard pasted each sheet end on end and rolled it around a section of a broom handle. The resulting roll contained 23,853 signatures and, with the addition of 7,000 further signatures before it was presented to Parliament, the petition attained the suffragists‘ original target of 30,000 signatories. The roll was presented to Parliament with great drama. John Hall, Member of Parliament and suffrage supporter, brought it into the house and unrolled it down the central aisle of the debating chamber until it hit the end wall with a thud. The 1893 women‘s franchise petition is on display in the Constitution Room at Archives New Zealand, Wellington, along with a facsimile of the first sheet, bearing the signature of Kate Sheppard. A microfilm copy of the full petition is available in Archives New Zealand‘s public reading room, along with an alphabetical name index of signatories and a transcript with geographical listings. The dataset includes data that has been transcribed from the original handwritten petition. Some names and locations were illegible and have not been included.
